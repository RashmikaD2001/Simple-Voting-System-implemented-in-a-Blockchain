# Blockchain Voting System

This project is a simple voting system implemented using blockchain technology in Python. Each vote is recorded as a block in the blockchain, and proof-of-work ensures that the integrity of each block is maintained. The blockchain can be validated to ensure that no tampering has occurred.

This is a **console application**, and a bar graph visualizes the final voting results using **matplotlib**.

## Features
- **Blockchain with Proof of Work**: Ensures the integrity of each vote.
- **Voting System**: Users can vote, and each vote is added as a block in the blockchain.
- **Blockchain Validation**: Verify that all blocks and votes are untampered.
- **Bar Graph Visualization**: Visualize the final voting results using `matplotlib`.

## Libraries Used
1. **time**: Used to create a timestamp for each block.
2. **hashlib**: Used for cryptographic hashing to create unique block hashes. SHA256 algorithm is used in the is application.
3. **matplotlib**: Used to visualize the voting results in a bar graph format.
